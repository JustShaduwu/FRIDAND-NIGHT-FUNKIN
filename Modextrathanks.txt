Especial Thanks for:
-Creators of the Doki Doki Takeover mod, surely duster, because I like the modxd, 
and because the "gf countdown" animation is based on the one present there.
-Gryscl, the melody for the intro drums of "Habits" is inspired by that of his song: Roots. Besto Corruption song lolol
-Tomygray, well, due to the modifications made in the weird engine, the compatibility with different languages, the character selector, etc. is appreciated.
-Marshmello, Toby Fox, n loswnesquecomponenlamusicaparalosbailesdefortnite, because in "Alone" there are multiple references to his works.
-To all the random people on yt who do tutorials for psych, because you really helped me learn some of this funkin haxe programming. also, to the community 
of the nonexistent question section on the Pyshc Engine github, some scripts were taken from there. Most have credits within them.
